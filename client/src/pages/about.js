        AdoptADog was developed by dog lovers Peter Bishop, Ryan Geisreiter,
        Joshua Abeyta, and Taylor Smith. We wanted to incorporate our love of
        dogs into a useful app that could be used to find a dog to adopt for any
        prospective current or future dog owner. We would love to be able to
        expand functionality and add sections for cats and other animals based
        on the location specified of the user in the future.
